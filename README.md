# Eclipse Import Projects Plug-in

This plug-in allows import of projects using an Eclipse command-line parameter. It is useful
in situations where Maven is producing the .project files and Eclipse would ideally import/refresh
them when launched.

## Installation

Place the com.seeq.eclipse.importprojects JAR file in the eclipse/plugins folder.

## Usage

When launching Eclipse, add the `-import <root project folder>` command line parameter. This will
cause Eclipse to recursively search the supplied folder for .project files and import them into
the workspace. If they are already present in the workspace, they will be refreshed. The path supplied
must be an absolute path.

You can supply multiple `-import` directives to import multiple folders. E.g. `-import <folder 1> -import <folder 2>`.

The plugin will log activity and any errors to the Eclipse *Error Log* view (`Window > Show View > Other > Error Log`).

### Headless

The aforementioned usage will import the projects on eclipse startup and will utimately place you in the IDE.
To perform a headless-import that does not actually start the IDE, run with `-application com.seeq.eclipse.importprojects.headlessimport`.
On Windows use `eclipsec` instead of `eclipse` launcher.

```
eclipsec.exe -nosplash -application com.seeq.eclipse.importprojects.headlessimport -data <workspace-folder> -import <import-folder>
```

## Supported Configurations

This plugin has been tested with Eclipse Helios (4.2), Kepler (4.3), Luna (4.4) and Mars (4.5) against Java 7 and 8. 
It will probably work with other configurations but they haven't been tested.

## Building

This plugin builds using Maven. It has been tested with Maven 3.2.3+.

With Maven on your path, execute `mvn package` from the root of the repository.

The update site will be under `eclipse-import-projects.site/target`.

### Building as OSGi bundle

This way has been used from the very beginning of this plugin development.
The content of `eclipse-import-projects.plugin` folder is enough.
Original `pom.xml` was renamed to not conflict with maven/tycho build.

    cd eclipse-import-projects.plugin
    mvn -f pom-osgi.xml package

The target
folder will contain the resulting jar file.

Note that this will overwrite `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file content,
so you would need to revert it back if using maven/tycho build.

## Debugging

You can debug this plugin from Eclipse using the Plugin Development Environment. Take the following steps:

1. Create the Eclipse project files from Maven by executing `mvn eclipse:eclipse` at the root of the repo.
2. Install the "Eclipse for RCP and RAP Developers" edition of Eclipse and launch it.
3. Import the plugin project via `File > Import... > General > Existing Projects into Workspace`.
4. Go to `Preferences > Java > Build Path > Classpath Variables` and add an `M2_REPO` variable if it
   doesn't already exist. It should point to your local Maven repository, which by default is `~/.m2/repository`. 
5. Open up `ImportProjects.java` and put a breakpoint in `earlyStartup()`.
6. Select `Run > Debug Configurations...` and click `Eclipse Application`.
7. Press the `New` button to create a new debug configuration. Call it whatever you like.
8. Click on the `Arguments` tab and add an `-import <dir>` directive to the `Program arguments` section.
9. Click on `Apply` and then `Debug` and you should hit your breakpoint.
